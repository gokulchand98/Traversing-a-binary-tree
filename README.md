# Traversing-a-binary-tree

Implementing a Python algorithm to traverse a binary tree alternating between depth-first and breadth-first searches, summing numerical values and concatenating strings encountered. Developing a data structure combining a hash table and a balanced binary search tree for dynamic resizing. Also, created a function to find the maximum subarray sum and its indices in a given list of integers using a divide-and-conquer approach with O(n log n) time complexity and O(1) space complexity.
